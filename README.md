# AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System
ðŸ”— **Live Project Link:** [AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System](https://ai-powered-resume-screening-and-ranking-system.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System** is a **Streamlit-based web application** designed to automate the recruitment process by analyzing and ranking resumes based on job descriptions. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **TF-IDF with Cosine Similarity**, the system extracts and evaluates relevant information from resumes to determine the best candidates for a given job role.

## Features

- **Resume Parsing**: Extracts text from PDF resumes using **PyPDF2**.
- **Candidate Ranking**: Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to rank resumes.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for easy user interaction.
- **Automated Resume Screening**: Reduces manual effort by providing instant candidate rankings.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend & Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **NLP & Text Processing**: Scikit-learn (TF-IDF), Cosine Similarity
- **File Handling**: PyPDF2 (for PDF text extraction)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeelBorad00/AI-powered-Resume-Screening-and-Ranking-System.git
cd AI-powered-Resume-Screening-and-Ranking-System
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
